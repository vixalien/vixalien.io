  summary:
    'How I made this blog, and how, and was it easy and is it necessary and everything else you need, or not to know about this.'
};

## It may not be evident at first sight, but it is _COMPLICATED_

First of all let me tell you the moral.

I was digging thru sites like [Tania's](//taniarascia.com) and [Flavio's](//flaviocopes.com), they have amazing blogs and all, and I decided to create mine, too, It was not easy and it shows; The results are: **ABOMINABLE**.

### The Cloning

[swr]: //swr.now.sh

To get started, I cloned [SWR], their site was cool and it was open-source (Thank you [Vercel](vercel.com)), and plus, I had tried creating one from scratch from [NextJS](//nextjs.org)'s tutorials, but they were too basic and they were complicated an stuff. Plus, I needed to use [MDX](//mdxjs.org) (It's just JSX for Markdown) but `nextJS and MDX` didn't give hits (usable hits) on google.

### Dev #1

So I decided on cloning the stuff ([SWR]).

This one was easy.

The next part: Introducing my stuff: Whole easy, because a the time, I hadn't much to code, except adding my own logos and renaming stuff, at the end, the homepage just <mark>worked</mark>.

### Dev #2

This part is on introducing the blogging part: wasn't easy at all.

First I scrambled old parts [...]
